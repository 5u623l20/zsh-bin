TODO:

- build on macOS
- add `-f FILE` and `-u URL` to `install` (at most one can be set); if these options are specified,
  it becomes legal to pass `-s SHA256` and `-m MD5` (both are OK)
- unless `-kk` is set, check sha256 or md5 in `install`; if no match, or no binary to check with,
  bail out unless `-k` is set.

Disable Windows Defender from Powershell running under Administrator:

  Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true

packages:
  bash
  dash
  autoconf
  binutils
  gcc-core
  gcc-g++
  groff
  make
  libncurses-devel
  libiconv-devel
  perl
